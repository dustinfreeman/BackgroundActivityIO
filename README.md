# BackgroundActivityIO

A C# wrapper for data generated as part of the [Background Activity Project](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~dustin/backgroundactivity/). See that page to request access to the full dataset.

The Background Activity Dataset embeds hand-based gestures in the context of naturalistic, multi-person background activity in a living room-like setting.
